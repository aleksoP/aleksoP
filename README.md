## LASDRA Teleoperation System

VR Digital Twin • Aerial Manipulation • Teleoperation

Role: Lead Developer — Seoul National University  
Technologies: Unreal Engine 5, ROS2, Meta Quest 2, Franka Emika, PyQt, C++, Python

What I Built:
- Digital Twin in Unreal Engine 5 with real-time LiDAR, IMU, and motion-capture integration
- VR Interface for immersive spatial awareness and precise manipulation
- Hand-tracking viewport control using the VIST glove
- Haptic teleoperation using the Franka Emika robot as a master device
- Unified PyQt control GUI for joint locking, flight modes, and system states
- Multi-PC architecture using NNG for high-performance real-time data streaming

Outcome:
Teleoperated a large-scale aerial robot through an oil-refinery valve-turning task using VR guidance and force-feedback control.

Thesis: “VR Digital Twin & Hand-Tracking Interface for Aerial Manipulator Operators”
